# Repository Decision

A **Repository Decision** preserves a settled choice whose rationale or constraints cannot be recovered reliably from the current implementation.

## Use this for

- Durable architecture, scope, dependency, data-model, or workflow choices.
- Choices with plausible alternatives that future maintainers may revisit.
- Replacements for earlier decisions whose supersession must remain explicit.

Do not use it for routine implementation choices, change summaries, delivery status, or facts available from git.

## Minimum record

- `# Decision` — the settled choice.
- `# Why` — only the context and rejected alternatives needed to avoid rediscovery.
- `# Constraints` — optional consequences future work must preserve.
- `supersedes` — optional frontmatter link to a replaced decision.
